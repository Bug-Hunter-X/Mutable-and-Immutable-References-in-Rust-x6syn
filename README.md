# Mutable and Immutable References in Rust

This repository demonstrates a common pitfall when working with mutable and immutable references in Rust.  The example code shows how an immutable reference prevents modification of the underlying value, even if a mutable reference exists elsewhere.  The solution shows how to avoid this issue by careful management of the mutable references.
